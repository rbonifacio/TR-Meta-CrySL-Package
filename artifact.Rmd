# Abstract

APIs are the primary mechanism for developers to gain access to externally defined services and tools. However, previous research has revealed API misuses that violate the contract of APIs to be prevalent. Such misuses can have harmful consequences, especially in the context of cryptographic libraries. Various API-misuse detectors have been proposed to address this issue---including CogniCrypt, one of the most versatile of such detectors and that uses a language (CrySL) to specify cryptographic API usage contracts. Nonetheless, existing approaches to detect API misuse had not been designed for systematic reuse, ignoring the fact that different versions of a library, different versions of a platform, and different recommendations/guidelines might introduce variability in the correct usage of an API. Yet, little is known about how such variability impacts the specification of the correct API usage. This paper investigates this question by analyzing the impact of various sources of variability on widely used Java cryptographic libraries (including JCA/JCE, Bouncy Castle, and Google Tink). The results of our investigation show that sources of variability like new versions of the API and security standards significantly impact the specifications. We then use the insights gained from our investigation to motivate an extension to the CrySL language  (named MetaCrySL), which builds on meta-programming concepts. We evaluate MetaCrySL by specifying usage rules for a family of Android versions and illustrate that MetaCrySL can model all forms of variability we identified and drastically reduce the size of a family of specifications for the correct usage of cryptographic APIs. **In this artifact package**, we present the 
tools, datasets, and scripts used in the research.   

# (1) MetaCrySL implementations

We have two implementations of MetaCrySL: the first, based on Rascal-MPL, is 
discussed in the paper; the second, based on XText, is the most up-to-date 
implementation. 

   * [MetaCrySL in Rascal](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/MetaCrySL)
   * [MetaCrySL in XText](https://github.com/PAMunb/MetaCrySL) 
   
Detailed instructions about how to set up and use these implementations are 
available in the respective repositories. 

## Running the Rascal implementation from Eclipse 

The following video explains how 
to use the MetaCrySL Rascal version from Eclipse. 

[![MetaCrySL on YouTube](mcsl.png){ width=50% }](https://youtu.be/PmYWK926RrM)

## Running the Rascal implementation from the command line 

It is also possible to run the Rascal implementation from the command line. 
You must have git, wget, and Java Development Kit 8 (or above). 
To run MetaCrySL Rascal from the command line, follow these steps from a terminal: 

````{shell}
$ mkdir mcsl
$ cd mcsl
$ wget https://update.rascal-mpl.org/console/rascal-shell-stable.jar
$ alias rascal-shell="java -Xmx1G -Xss32m -jar $(pwd)/rascal-shell-stable.jar"
$ git clone https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/MetaCrySL.git
$ cd MetaCrySL
$ rascal-shell

rascal> import generator::Main;

rascal> main(|cwd:///samples/jca/android/config/Android0108.config|);
```
      
**Note:** You must review the `src` and `out` paths 
of the configuration files. These configuration files are 
within the following folders: 

   * samples/jca/android/config/
   * samples/jca/android-cc/config/
   * samples/jca/android-bsi/config/

The `src` folder must point to the full-qualified path of the `samples/jca/base` 
directory (within the MetaCrySL local repository). You can decide where MetaCrySL 
should generate the resulting CrySL rules (the `out` directory).   

## Running the Rascal implementation from a Docker Image       

We also made available a docker image. To use it, proceed as follow:

```{shell}
$ docker pull rbonifacio/mcsl-java8
$ docker run -it rbonifacio/mcsl-java8:v1 bash
root@...:/mcsl> cd MetaCrySL
root@...:/mcsl/MetaCrySL> rascal-shell
rascal> import generator::Main;
rascal> main(|cwd:///samples/jca/android/config/Android0108.config|);
```


   

# (2) Domain Analysis 

To better understand the impacts of variability on API misuse specification, we conducted a domain analysis that sought to understand reuse opportunities across Crypto-API- usage specifications, considering different libraries and their different versions, different cryptographic primitives, and different cryptographic standards. 

As such, we answer the following research questions. 

   * (RQ1) How do different APIs and their implementations vary the specifications 
     of the correct usage of cryptographic primitives? 
     
   * (RQ2) How do existing cryptographic standards vary the notion of secure 
     or compliant use of cryptographic libraries?  
     
   *  (RQ3) How does the evolution of a cryptographic library vary its correct usage over time?
   
   
To answer the first research question we started reading the official documentation, books,
tutorials in gray literature, code examples, and test cases of the following 
libraries. 

   * [Java JCA / JCE](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/security/toc.htm)
   * [Java Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/)
   * [Java Google Tink](https://github.com/google/tink)
   * [C/C++ WolfCrypt](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfcrypt-2/) 
   * [C/C++ OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
   
We also contribute by writing [CrySL](https://www.eclipse.org/cognicrypt/documentation/crysl/) specifications for several primitives of the Bouncy Castle and Google Tink 
libraries. These specifications could be found in the 
[CrySL Rules repository](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/Crypto-API-Rules). To 
answer the second research question, we mined the documentation of three 
cryptographic standards: 

   * [NIST FIPS](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/2/final) 
   * [BSI](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-1.html)
   * [Ecrypt D5.4](https://www.ecrypt.eu.org/csa/documents/D5.4-FinalAlgKeySizeProt.pdf)


and updated an initial set of CrySL specifications tailored for each one of 
these cryptographic standards. Afterwards, we generated complete 
sets of CrySL specifications using MetaCrySL. To anwswer the third 
research question we mined the evolution of Java cryptographic libraries 
(JCA/JCE, Bouncy Castle, and Google Tink). 

### Cryptographic API Evolution and Breaking Changes

   * [API Evolution tool](https://github.com/rbonifacio/api-evolution)
   * [Breaking Changes tool](https://github.com/rbonifacio/apidiff/)
     
      We implemented a slight extension to the [APIDiff library](https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/apidiff) that computes 
      the breaking changes between two revisions. This additional feature 
      could be used according to the following test case. 
      
```{java class.source="java", eval=F}
@Test
public void testMethodBreakingChanges() {
  try {
    String r1rv60 = "52b0902592e770b8116f80f2eab7a4048b589d7d"; // commit id for revision r1rv60
	String r1rv59 = "6de1c17dda8ffdb19431ffcadbce1836867a27a9"; // commit id for revision r1rv59
			
	String out = getClass().getResource("/").getFile();
			
	APIDiff diff = new APIDiff("bc", "https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java.git");
			
	diff.setPath(out);
			
	Result res = diff.detectChangeBetweenRevisions(r1rv60, r1rv59, Classifier.API);
			
	long methodBreakingChanges = res.getChangeMethod().stream()
			                             .filter(c -> c.isBreakingChange())
			                             .count();
			
	Assert.assertEquals(40, methodBreakingChanges); // expecting 40 methodBreakingChanges
			
  }
  catch(Exception ex) {
	 Assert.fail();
  }
}
```
   
We used this [program](https://github.com/FHandrick/apiTimeLife) to compute the 
breaking changes from Bouncy Castle and Google Tink. Regarding JCA / JCE, we 
follow a manual approach of reading the JavaDoc of the API classes among its 
different revisions.

# (3) MetaCrySL empirical assessment 

We evaluated MetaCrySL regarding two dimensions: (a) Compactness (how many 
lines of specification we can save using MetaCrySL and how much duplication 
of specifications we can save using MetaCrySL) and (b) Correctness (observing 
the implications of using the outcomes of MetaCrySL to mine the incorrect 
usage of crypto API). 

In this study we used MetaCrySL to specify 
different sets of CrySL specifications for 
the Android platform. These specifications 
address all JCA/JCE cryptographic primitives, the guidelines from 
three cryptographic **recommendations** 
(from the [BSI standard](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-1.html), from the [CogniCrypt project](https://www.eclipse.org/cognicrypt/), 
and from the [Google Android Cryptographic documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/cryptography)), 
and three ranges of the Android platform versions (01 -- 08, 01 -- 16, 01 -- 28). 
The following table shows the nine configurations we derive from 
these MetaCrySL specifications. 


| Config. Id | Primitives      | Android Platform Version | Crypto Standard                      |

| C01        | All primitives  | 01 -- 08                 | Android Base recommendations         |
| C02        | All primitives  | 01 -- 16                 | Android Base recommendations         |
| C03        | All primitives  | 01 -- 28                 | Android Base recommendations         |

| C08        | All primitives  | 01 -- 16                 | Android CogniCrypt recommendations   |
| C09        | All primitives  | 01 -- 28                 | Android CogniCrypt recommendations   |
